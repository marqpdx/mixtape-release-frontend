# AGENTS.md - Repository Root

Purpose: conservative operating guide for agents working in this monorepo.

## Priority and Scope
- This file applies repository-wide unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` exists in a subdirectory.
- More specific `AGENTS.md` files take precedence for files in their subtree.
- Keep changes scoped to the user request; avoid unrelated cleanup.

## Conservative Defaults
- Ask for confirmation before editing files.
- Ask for confirmation before running state-changing commands (tests, builds, installs, formatters, generators, migrations).
- Prefer read-only investigation first (list files, inspect configs, review existing patterns).
- Do not use network access unless explicitly approved for that command.
- Do not run destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, force pushes) unless explicitly requested.
- Do not create commits, tags, or branches unless explicitly requested.

## Meridian Code Intelligence Discipline

Meridian is Mixtape's shared code intelligence layer, exposed through Switchboard MCP.

- Meridian/Wiki provides narrative explanations of files and modules.
- Meridian/Index provides symbol graphs, call edges, import maps, route bindings, test relationships, and related file maps.

Use Meridian for orientation before falling back to direct file reads or text search.

### Lookup Priority
1. Meridian/Wiki: understand what a file or module means.
2. Meridian/Index: understand symbols, routes, dependencies, and blast radius.
3. Direct file reads: inspect implementation details only after Meridian orientation.
4. `rg` / file search: use only when Meridian has no result or the target is not a symbol.

### Session Start
At the beginning of a new session in this repo, run:

1. `repo_overview(scope?)`
2. `query_governing_docs(area)`

Use `repo_overview` to establish the current module map and repo structure.
Use `query_governing_docs` to identify ADRs, specs, and project rules that govern the work area.

If the work area is unclear, start with the broadest reasonable area, then narrow once the task is understood.

### Before Reading Unfamiliar Files
- Use `explain_file(path)` for a file-level narrative before reading an unfamiliar file.
- Use `explain_module(app_name)` before working in an unfamiliar app or package.

Read the file only when Meridian's summary is insufficient for the implementation question being answered.

### Before Using Search Tools
Before using `rg`, `grep`, `glob`, `find`, or broad file search, prefer Meridian structural lookup:

- Use `find_symbol(name, repo?)` before searching for a class, function, constant, hook, component, command, or setting.
- Use `find_callers(symbol, repo?)` before manually tracing who calls something.
- Use `find_callees(symbol, repo?)` before manually tracing dependencies.
- Use `trace_model(model_name)` before reading a model and its related surface.
- Use `trace_endpoint(route)` before working on an API endpoint or route.
- Use `related_files(path)` before manually following imports.
- Use `search_code_semantic(query)` when the desired behavior is known but the location is not.

Use text search only when Meridian returns no useful result, the target is not a symbol, or the task requires an exact string, literal, error message, config key, CSS class, copy string, or route segment.

### Before Writing Code
Before changing code, establish context and blast radius:

1. `related_files(path)` - identify connected files and dependencies.
2. `related_tests(path_or_symbol)` - identify existing relevant tests.
3. `summarize_changed_files(base, head)` - understand branch changes before building on top of them.

Prefer small, targeted edits that follow existing Next.js and React project patterns. Do not introduce new architecture when an existing pattern already fits.

### Trust and Staleness Rules
- Trust Meridian for orientation. It is the shared, VPS-hosted index used by agents and refreshed regularly.
- If a Meridian result includes `is_stale: true`, state that the result is stale, use it only as orientation, and fall back to direct file reads for that specific query.
- If Meridian conflicts with direct file contents, surface the discrepancy. Use the file as the implementation source of truth for the immediate edit and treat the discrepancy as documentation/index drift.
- Fall back to file reads for implementation specifics, not for orientation.

### Available Meridian Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `repo_overview(scope?)` | Session start; establish repo/module structure |
| `query_governing_docs(area)` | Session start; identify ADRs/specs/rules for the work area |
| `explain_file(path)` | Before reading an unfamiliar file |
| `explain_module(app_name)` | Before working in an unfamiliar app or package |
| `find_symbol(name, repo?)` | Before text search for a class, function, constant, hook, component, or setting |
| `find_callers(symbol, repo?)` | Before tracing who calls a symbol |
| `find_callees(symbol, repo?)` | Before tracing what a symbol depends on |
| `trace_model(model_name)` | Before reading a model and its related surface |
| `trace_endpoint(route)` | Before working on an API endpoint or route |
| `related_files(path)` | Before changing a file; identify blast radius |
| `related_tests(path_or_symbol)` | Before adding or changing tests |
| `search_code_semantic(query)` | When the behavior is known but the location is not |
| `summarize_changed_files(base, head)` | Before building on top of branch changes |

Operating rule: Meridian first. Files second. Search last.

## Testing Work (Playwright / Frontend)
- Reuse existing Playwright setup and conventions before introducing new harnesses.
- Prefer incremental additions with clear naming and stable selectors.
- For new frontend tests requested by the user, stage work under `pre-tests/` first unless told otherwise.
- Document assumptions and required env/services before attempting to run tests.

## className Convention
- Add `className` to weight-bearing Chakra layout components: page roots, section containers, grids, nav bars, tab roots, and tab content areas.
- Skip leaf nodes such as `Text`, `Button`, and `Icon` unless there is a specific targeting need.
- Naming format is `prefix-semantic-name`, using a short 3-4 character prefix derived from the component name plus a semantic name.
- Examples: `glb-header`, `glbt-nav`, `glbo-root`.
- Add classNames when a component is first written or materially edited, not as a later retrofit.
- The purpose is stable targeting for CSS and layout instructions, so future edits can reference `.glbt-nav` instead of describing nested structure like "the second Box inside the Grid".

## Change Hygiene
- Before editing: summarize intended edits and target files.
- After editing: summarize exactly what changed and any follow-up verification steps.
- If instructions conflict or are ambiguous, stop and ask for clarification.

## Commit Handoff

After completing a commit that has been approved by the CTO, produce a
handoff note in the format below and present it clearly so the CTO can relay
it to the Puddlejump session for logging. Do not write to Puddlejump yourself
— the CTO is the gate.

    Repo:         mixtape-release-frontend
    Commit:       [short hash] — [one-line commit message]
    Date:         [YYYY-MM-DD]
    Work effort:  [ADR or initiative this belongs to]
    What was built:
      [2–4 sentences — what was implemented and why, written for someone
      reading this log months from now. Name the models, endpoints, or
      surfaces involved. Avoid vague summaries like "fixed some bugs."]
